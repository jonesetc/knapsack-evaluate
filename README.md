# knapsack-evaluate

BASH scripts and a c++ program to compile, run, evaluate, and generate a report 
about the run times of an implementation of the knapsack problem in c++. 
This was done for my Computer Architecture class at Texas State University.

# Notes

- I made this script to do my homework for me because it seemed like a good 
excuse to practice some scripting as well as a little bit of c++.
- I did not write the knapsack.cpp that I compiled, it was given to us by 
our professor, that's why it isn't included.
- If you're in my class, don't copy my work, punks.
